## 🌐 Self-Hosting Wonderland
Welcome to the humble home lab of a mad tinkerer!
This project documents how I’ve managed to host multiple services from my Synology NAS, using Docker containers, Cloudflare Tunnel, and a healthy dose of curiosity (plus caffeine).

## 🏗️ What’s Running Behind the Scenes?

💻 Personal Website – served from my NAS to the world via a Cloudflare Tunnel, because punching holes in my firewall felt too 2005.

🖼️ Grafana – for beautiful, borderline-obsessive dashboards about... everything.

🎮 Minecraft Server – because surviving creepers is a team-building exercise.

🤖 Power Automate Experiments – private but fascinating projects linked to rugplay.com
. (Yes, it’s as weird and cool as it sounds.)

## 🧰 Tools Used:
Tool	Why?
Synology NAS	My do-it-all home server 🧃
Docker	Containerization FTW 🐳
Cloudflare Tunnel	Secure, no port-forwarding VPN 🚪
Minecraft Server	Because blocks are life 🧱
Grafana	Pretty graphs make me feel powerful 📊
##🛠️ How It Works (in a Nutshell)

I run everything in Docker containers on my Synology NAS.

A Cloudflare Tunnel securely exposes select services to the web (without crying over NAT).

My DNS is managed via Cloudflare, so I can map subdomains like grafana.rugplay.com, minecraft.rugplay.com, etc.

Everything’s configured to be reliable, secure, and mostly cat-proof.
