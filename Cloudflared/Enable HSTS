Enable HSTS: ✅ Yes

Max Age Header:

Start with: 6 months (15768000 seconds)
After testing for a few weeks, increase to 12 months (31536000)
This gives you a safety window if something breaks
Apply HSTS to subdomains (includeSubDomains):

Only enable if ALL your subdomains use HTTPS
Do you have subdomains like www, admin, api, etc.?
If yes and they all work on HTTPS → ✅ Enable
If no subdomains or unsure → ❌ Leave disabled for now
Preload:

❌ Leave DISABLED for now
Preload is extremely permanent (hard to undo)
You can enable this later after HSTS runs smoothly for months
No-Sniff Header:

✅ Enable (you already have this in your code, so it's safe)
